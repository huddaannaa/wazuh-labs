# Wazuh Articles & Labs (Work in Progress)

This repository will host practical Wazuh write-ups and hands-on labs focused on deployment, detection engineering (rules/decoders), tuning, and real-world SOC use cases.

## Status
🚧 In progress, articles will be added gradually.  
The repo structure and templates are set so content stays consistent as it grows.

## Planned topics
- Wazuh architecture & components (manager / agent / indexer)
- Installation and hardening (Linux + Windows)
- Rules vs decoders (how parsing works)
- Writing custom rules (with test logs)
- Alert tuning / noise reduction strategy
- Sysmon + Windows event collection with Wazuh
- MITRE mapping and detection coverage tracking
- Integrations (Elastic/OpenSearch, SOAR, ticketing)
- Troubleshooting playbooks (common failures + fixes)

## Repo structure (planned)
- `articles/` → Markdown articles (e.g., `001-title.md`)
- `images/` → screenshots referenced by articles
- `configs/` → sample configurations
- `rules/` → custom Wazuh rules/decoders
- `scripts/` → helper scripts and testing utilities

## Naming convention
Articles will follow:
- `articles/001-<topic>.md`
- `articles/002-<topic>.md`
…so they stay ordered and easy to browse.
